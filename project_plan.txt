# TrulyFAQ - Project Plan

## Project Overview
TrulyFAQ is an API service for business websites to handle their Q&A and FAQ sections. The service will:
1. Receive questions from business websites via API endpoints
2. Store questions in a database
3. Provide a dashboard for website owners to answer questions
4. Send email notifications with answers to users
5. Provide API endpoints for websites to access Q&A data
6. Automatically identify frequently asked questions using AI
7. Allow management of FAQ visibility

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Django and Django Rest Framework
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- AI Integration: Groq AI API
- Email Service: Django's email functionality (can be extended to use services like SendGrid)
- Database: PostgreSQL (recommended for production, SQLite for development)

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Authentication System**
   - User registration and login
   - API key generation and management for client websites

2. **Question Management System**
   - Receiving and storing questions
   - Answering interface for website owners
   - Email notification system

3. **FAQ System**
   - AI-powered similarity detection
   - FAQ generation based on similarity threshold
   - FAQ visibility management

4. **API Layer**
   - Endpoints for submitting questions
   - Endpoints for retrieving Q&A data
   - Endpoints for retrieving FAQs

### Database Schema

#### User Model (extends Django's User)
- username
- email
- password
- is_website_owner (boolean)
- date_joined

#### Website Model
- owner (ForeignKey to User)
- name
- url
- api_key
- created_at
- updated_at

#### Question Model
- website (ForeignKey to Website)
- user_email
- question_text
- is_answered (boolean)
- created_at
- updated_at

#### Answer Model
- question (OneToOneField to Question)
- answer_text
- answered_by (ForeignKey to User)
- created_at
- updated_at
- email_sent (boolean)

#### FAQ Model
- website (ForeignKey to Website)
- question_text
- answer_text
- similarity_count (number of similar questions)
- is_visible (boolean)
- created_at
- updated_at

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/register/ - Register a new website owner
- POST /api/auth/login/ - Login for website owners
- POST /api/auth/generate-api-key/ - Generate a new API key

#### Question Endpoints
- POST /api/questions/ - Submit a new question (requires API key)
- GET /api/questions/ - Get all questions for a website (requires authentication)
- PUT /api/questions/{id}/answer/ - Answer a question

#### FAQ Endpoints
- GET /api/faqs/ - Get all FAQs for a website (requires API key)
- PUT /api/faqs/{id}/visibility/ - Toggle FAQ visibility

### AI Integration
- Use Groq AI API to compare new Q&A pairs with existing questions
- Calculate similarity scores
- If similarity count exceeds threshold (configurable percentage of total questions), add to FAQ

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication
1. Set up Django project with necessary apps
2. Configure database
3. Implement user authentication system
4. Implement API key generation and management

### Phase 2: Question Management System
1. Create models for Website, Question, and Answer
2. Implement API endpoints for question submission
3. Create dashboard for website owners to view and answer questions
4. Implement email notification system

### Phase 3: FAQ System
1. Create FAQ model
2. Implement Groq AI integration for similarity detection
3. Create logic for FAQ generation based on similarity threshold
4. Implement FAQ visibility management

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
1. Design and implement dashboard UI using Tailwind CSS
2. Create forms for answering questions
3. Implement FAQ management interface

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
1. Write unit tests for core functionality
2. Perform integration testing
3. Deploy to production server

## Security Considerations
1. API key authentication for external websites
2. JWT authentication for website owners
3. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Input validation and sanitization
5. CSRF protection

## Scalability Considerations
1. Database indexing for performance
2. Caching frequently accessed data
3. Asynchronous processing for email sending and AI analysis

## Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Implement logging for error tracking
2. Set up monitoring for API usage
3. Regular backups of database

## Future Enhancements
1. Analytics dashboard for question trends
2. Integration with popular CMS platforms (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
3. Advanced AI features for automatic answer suggestions
4. Multi-language support
